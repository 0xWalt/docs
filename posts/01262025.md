Simple challenge:

Stick to a plan... min $300 a week. No big moves, no flipping coins, just dollar-cost averaging into a couple of leading assets, like Bitcoin, every week for 15 years.

That’s it. Just buy week in and week out.

How well would you do after 15 years? 

Of course, there’s no guarantee. Crypto is volatile and hard to predict. But over 15 years? You’d have to be seriously unlucky to not get decent gains. The question is, are you patient enough to stick it out that long?

I’m curious. You?
