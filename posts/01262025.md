Simple challenge:

Dollar-cost averaging (min $300 per week) into a couple of leading assets, like Bitcoin, every week for 15 years.

That’s it. Just buy week in and week out. 

Of course, there’s no guarantee. Markets are volatile and hard to predict. But over 15 years? You’d have to be seriously unlucky to not get decent returns. The question is, am I patient enough to stick it out that long?

I’m curious. You?
