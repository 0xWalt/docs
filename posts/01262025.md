Here’s a simple challenge:

Let’s say you stick to a steady game plan: min $300 a week. No big moves, no flipping coins, just dollar-cost averaging into a couple of leading assets, like Bitcoin. You do this every week for 15 years.

That’s it. Just buy in, no matter what, week in and week out. You don’t stress over the price today or tomorrow. You don’t check your portfolio every 5 minutes. You just buy and live your life...

How well could you do after 15 years? 

How much without trying to time the market, without getting caught up in the latest pump, and without stressing over the next move?

How much could you build with that extra time? 

Of course, there’s no guarantee. Crypto is volatile and hard to predict. But over 15 years? You’d have to be seriously unlucky to not see decent gains. The question is, are you patient enough to stick it out that long?

I’m curious. You?
