There is no grand plan, no higher purpose, no guaranteed outcome.

We engage in creation and exchange, driven by both necessity and opportunity.

We obsess endlessly.

When we stop, it will all keep going without us.

We don’t expect applause or understanding.

We don’t need validation or expect recognition.

We dont want your sympathy.

There is no promise of success, nor assurance of failure. There is only the life — an endless flow of risk, reward, and decision.

We are here... and so we do.
