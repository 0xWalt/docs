There is no grand plan, no higher purpose, no guaranteed outcome.

We engage in creation and exchange driven by necessity and opportunity.

We obsess endlessly.

We don’t expect applause or understanding.

We don’t need validation.

We dont want your sympathy.

When we stop, it will all keep going without us.

There is no promise of success, nor assurance of failure. There is only life — an endless flow of risk, reward, and decision.

We are here... and so we do.
